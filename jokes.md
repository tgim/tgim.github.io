### Going alone some place

<pre class="joke">
Husband asking the wife: Darling, do you want to come with me to the gym?
Wife: Are you saying I'm fat?

Husband: No, I was just thinking that we should maybe...
Wife: Are you saying I'm lazy?

Husband: No, no! Calm down, I didn't say that..
Wife: Why, you think I'm hysterical?

Husband: No, I wasn't saying that..
Wife: So you are calling me a liar now?

Husband: God no! You know what, I go alone then.
Wife: Wait a minute! Why do you want to go alone!?
