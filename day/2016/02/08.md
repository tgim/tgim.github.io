- As discussed last night, no one wakes up at 6 to go early to get documents
- I wake up at 7 AM and start compleing the daily chores: kids bottle wash, making breakfast and more
- At 8:30 wife wakes up
- Announces that we need to go to her parents place to pick documents for her visa interview
- After a lot of heat and abuse, as always, I give up
- At 10:30 AM we drop the kid to day-care and move to the city where her parents live
- We reach around 12:15 PM - we are told to meet in front of a hotel in the city
- Her parents arrive a few minutes after we reach the hotel
- Wifey goes to their car, looks to be looking in some papers
- Five minutes later - tells me - that she is going to her home to pick some more documents and will be back in 10-15 minutes
