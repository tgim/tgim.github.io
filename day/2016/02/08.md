- As discussed last night, no one wakes up at 6 to go early to get documents
- I wake up at 7 AM and start compleing the daily chores: kids bottle wash, making breakfast and more
- At 8:30 wife wakes up
- Announces that we need to go to her parents place to pick documents for her visa interview
- After a lot of heat and abuse, as always, I give up
- At 10:30 AM we drop the kid to day-care and move to the city where her parents live
- We reach around 12:15 PM - we are told to meet in front of a hotel in the city
- Her parents arrive a few minutes after we reach the hotel
- Wifey goes to their car, looks to be looking in some papers
- Five minutes later - tells me - that she is going to her home to pick some more documents and will be back in 10-15 minutes
- Wifey arrives a full 1.5 hours (and more) late
- Tried reaching her a couple of times during this time... she didn't pick up her phone most of the times
- Picked up twice and always told reaching in a few minutes
- I am sitting in the car, parked roadside like a fool for good 1.5 hours
- Haven't eaten anything since morning - the hotel guard has asked me multiple times what am I doing there
- Wifey and her parents don't even have the courtesy to tell me some rough estimate - leave alone calling their son-in-law home
- And then, I am accused of torturing my wife for dowry
