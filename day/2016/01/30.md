- Our daughter had high fever in the night and thus we wake up post 9AM and rush to the doctor
- The doctor advises medicines
- Wifey is hell bent that its the day-care guys who have done something wrong yesterday
- Speaks on the same to the doctor too and exaggerates the timings to 12PM and that they charge if we are minutes late in picking kiddo up
