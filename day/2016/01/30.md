- Our kid had high fever in the night and thus we wake up post 9AM and rush to the doctor
- The doctor advises medicines
- Wifey is hell bent that its the day-care guys who have done something wrong yesterday
- Speaks on the same to the doctor too and exaggerates the timings to 12PM and that they charge if we are minutes late in picking kiddo up. Far exaggerated - never had been charged till date. They are a bit late in starting up - 9:30AM against the 9 AM expected
- We go and check out a day care at wife's insistence - not up to the mark
- We pick up some breakfast and then rush home for medicines
- Wife gets to know that the maid is back
- She has a quarrel over the month-ending date with the maid
- Don't know why but wifey's anger is increasing minute by minute
- The maid being too late (already 12:45PM) asks to do a part of cleaning in the evening
- This turns ugly with a verbal fight between wifey and maid
- The maid asks wifey to look for another one and says that our house has very high attrition rate
- At this my wife is mad, and hits below the belt - attacking her personal life. I warn her but she keeps going and her married personal life
- The above line leads to both getting into a heated argument, at which the maid leaves
- The day passes on - we get another maid
- Without lunch we all go to sleep
- In the evening, me and wifey discuss on how to handle my upcoming office trip
- I tell her that if she is unable to manage herself I can ask my mom to come over
- She says it will be easier if her mom comes over - I have no issues
- She calls up her father who sort of agrees and asks her to call back
- We play with our kid, make her feed and then make her doze off
- Wifey now leaves home to call her parents
- Comes back furious 10 minutes later and hurls abuses to me and my parents - says that my mom can never come over
- Gets a call from her parents again - asks for her father - and makes me talk to him
- He refuses saying that his house will be left vacant and that he has some work
- Wifey anger is again raging
- Her mom calls in a few minutes later again
- At this point she tells wifey that she is too damn ill and not in a condition to come over - and that they hid this fact from her for days
- Wife is now at her best - hurling abuses, cursing me
- Goes on to threaten me that when I go for my official trip and if kid goes unwell again - she will cause a permanent damage to me
- I ignore and carry on to pack up the night
