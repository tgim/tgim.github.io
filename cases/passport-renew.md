## Curious case of passport renewal

Early last year, I wass officially asked to attend an office meeting in the US. In the evening, I informed
my wife of the same - how I was mentally tortured and broken is yet <a href="#">another story</a>. This case
just pertains to what happened to her passport renewal process, that started as an offset to this news.

We at one time decided that my wife and my kid will accompany me to the US. Now was the big problem. We had
no passport for our kid. We went to the online passport site, and found that to apply for the kids passport,
we needed that the spouse name was endorsed on one of the parents passport. None of my or my wife's passport
had the spouse name endorsed.

As my passport had the US Visa stamped, we decided that we will get her passport renewed for spouse name
endorsement. We needed the marriage certificate for the same. Good that we got it made an year or so back. I
asked my wife for the same. She searched frantically and after almost 8 hours informed me that the certificate
was missing. She then accused me of stealing me, so I searched my wardrobe and found nothing. It was 11 in the
night and then I left for my office to search if I had kept the marriage certificate. It was not found.

The certificate had actually been submitted my wife in her office for PF transfer. Instead of submitting the
photo-copy (as my wife changed her surname after marriage, it was needed to indicate that they are the same
person) she submitted the original to her office.

I was screwed at this point, and started the process to get a duplicate. After 2 days and 2000 rupees spent,
I got another legal copy of the marriage certificate. 

We applied for a **TATKAL** renewal of her passport, scheduled the appointment and approached the PSK. Her
application was rejected at the PSK due to the following reasons:

* We were to use the current address where we resided, having the same address on my passport, it will not
work as well - as my passport was 7 years old. So we cannot apply for tatkal passport.

* We needed an address proof in her name such as **Aadhar card** to apply

We were informed at the PSK that we could use her pre-marriage address, the same address mentioned on her
previous passport for **TATKAL**. We re-applied for her passport with the address now the one as of pre-marriage.
We again took an appointment at PSK.
