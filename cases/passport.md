title: Curious case of missing passport
---

One fine day within an year of marriage, I received a call from my wife. She had taken a day off and was
enjoying her day at home. She said

> She cannot find her passport at home. She seems to have lost it. She needs to file a police complaint
> immediately and that I should leave everything at work and rush home.

I said, that she could wait till the evening, the end-of-business, and then we can search in the home.
How can a small document get lost from home, when it has not been used recently. She started shouting
and calling me names, even going to an extent to say, that I might have stole the passport.

I called up her father to pacify her. Rather than understanding that I am in office, and one needs to
complete work, he said:

> Go immediately to home and then to the police station. What can be more important than filing a FIR
> right now. What if someone commits a murder and drops my daughter's passport there?

I explained just finding a passport won't make her the murderer. And that these things happen only in
movies. But to no avail. The man did not listen.

During this course, I got more than 20 calls from my wife, abusing/cursing/shouting at me. I then packed
for the day, and left. Anyways I was not able to work at office due to such high volume of calls.

At home, I looked for passport again. Within 15 minutes of my searching the entire room, I found the
passport lying slipped under the drawer in which the passport was kept. To anyone who has some mind left
in him, it would seem that the passport would have fallen when taking out something else. And would have
slipped underneath due to feet movement.

But it has been years, since today, but my wife still accuses me of stealing the passport then.
