title: My official trip and kid catches pneumonia
---

In winters of India, I had to leave for an official trip within India. As always my wife was reluctant to let me go
and I being prepared asked her to accompany me for the same. But this meant that my wife skips office which she lately
agreed to. Now a twist happened that my wife was asked to apply for a **US VISA** by her office and thus she had to 
stay back. It was agreed that she will join me in the coming weekend, as I was leaving on a Sunday late-night flight.

The day I had to leave my wife made sure that I get late due to every possible way.
