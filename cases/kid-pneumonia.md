title: My official trip and kid catches pneumonia
social: true
---

In winters of India, I had to leave for an official trip within India. As always my wife was reluctant to let me go
and I being prepared asked her to accompany me for the same. But this meant that my wife skips office which she lately
agreed to. Now a twist happened that my wife was asked to apply for a **US VISA** by her office and thus she had to 
stay back. It was agreed that she will join me in the coming weekend, as I was leaving on a Sunday late-night flight.

The day I had to leave my wife made sure that I get late due to every possible way ([read more here](cases/haircut-wife-kid.html)).

A few hours later I was in another city of our motherland. Once I had settled into the hotel, and had connected back
online, I received a message from my wife that the kid had fever. It was tough for me to digest the news as wifey had
many a times in the past made false news of being hit with fever when she was not - the latest being just a few days
back. I called her up but the call went unanswered - it was too too late in the night and she might have been asleep.
I left her a message to call me as soon as she woke up.

[still to write...]

I was about to board the flight in the evening and was waiting for boarding, when my wife informed me that she was
not coming today. I informed her that I had no keys to home - she said they didn't get a driver. I argued her to get
a cab and come-over which she declined. I reached late in the night at the airport. As I had no keys to the house, I
spent the night at a coffee house near the airport. 

Wifey had told me that she will come in early morning so that we could visit our regular doctor in the morning. Considering
that the doctor is avaiable till 10 AM, I reached home from the airport by 7 AM in the morning. I called my wife but
the calls went unanswered. I called my father-in-law but to same response. At around 8:45 AM I got a call from my wife
telling me that she will start from home in an hour. I told her to make it early as we would otherwise miss the doctor.

At around 9:30 AM she asked me whether she should give the morning medicine to the kid. I said yes. A later while she
asked me whether she should get the **nebulizing** done in the morning to which again I said yes. I also pleaded with
her to get the prescription papers as they would be required to be shown to the doctor. At around 12:30 PM she arrived
along with her entire family - her father, mother and the driver. She had no haste in actions to go to the doctor.

I immediately opened the house door, and picked up the car keys and asked wifey to accompany. She wanted me to chit-chat
with her parents but I wanted to meet the doctor. After normal pleasanteries we (me, wife and the kid) left for the
doctor.

At the doctor's place, I asked my wife to brief the doctor as I myself was not aware of the conditions. At this point,
wife told that she had forgotten the prescription papers and she had brought medicines that they were given. Doctor
gave us a stern look, as the dose of the medicine and the frequency and the previous doctor's diagnosis was not
available. The doctor then recommended an X-ray for the kid.

I also got to know that the doctor at her native place, had advised **nebulizing** since last Monday but they forget
and the earliest they got it done was **Friday night** - a full 4 days later. I just could not understand how a mother
along with 3 other adults at home could miss getting medicine administered to the kid. Later I also came to know that
during these 4 days, my wife took the kid atleast twice for shopping (once to a jeweller and the second time to pick
up a cycle for the kid)

Getting the X-ray done was tough - wife refused to come inside the X-ray room, and holding the child straight and making
sure that the kid didn't move hands or feet all alone, with no clothes on was too tough for me. However, by god's grace
I could get the X-ray done.

In the evening when we showed the X-ray to the doctor, the kid was prescribed `nebulizing` every 2 hours for the next
couple of days, along with two anti-biotics. The kid started getting better with the inflow of medicines in her body.
