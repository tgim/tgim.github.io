title: Haircut for Wife and Kid
---

This incident happened when I had to leave for an official trip within the country. My flight was scheduled
for late Sunday night and the cab was booked for 6 PM. Read the whole story at [Official trip and kid catches 
Pneumoina](#)

My wife wanted a hair-cut before I left and thus it was decided that she will go herself on Sunday morning to
a parlour near our home (less thana kilo-meter away) at around 1 AM. I hadn't packed as I wanted to wash and 
iron my clothes before, and Saturday wifey was busy washing and drying all the kids and her clothes. I kept the 
same for Sunday.

Come Sunday morning, and I woke up early to wash my clothes. I knew I would not get a chance later. I tried
waking up my wife, but she kept sleeping till 10AM when my kid helped me out by waking her up. She finally had
to get up. Then she wanted to have breakfast and made sure that she had a very lazy breakfast. It was already
1 PM when I got anguished and asked her to move if she wanted a cut.

At this point, she stated she wanted to go to a parlour some 15 kilo-meters away and that I will have to take
her there as I had committed a crime by travelling officialy and I had to make a penance. I finally had to agree
to her insance demand. Taking the kid along with, we visited the parlour. She informed that she will either have a
hair-cut or some dandruff treatment and would be free before 3 PM. I kept waiting in the car with the kid playing
with her, and keeping her entertained. At 3 PM I called her and was informed it will take another 20 minutes before
she would be free.

At this point, I went to the parlour as the kid was getting cranky. We kept on waiting and finally by 4 PM the wife
was free. She had gotten a hair-cut, a dandruff treatment and all other regular services. I was a little upset as
I had only 2 hours left, before I could pack my stuff which included ironing my clothes as they were not fully dry.

After we left the parlour, mid-way my wife came up with a new demand: the kid needs a hair-cut too. I kept making
her understand that I was already late, and we could get her a cut next weekend, but my wife did not budge. She started
abusing me, calling me names and made the next 10 minutes a living hell for me - when I succumbed and had to return
back to the parlour for kid's hair-cut.

Another drama ensued when my wife refused to get down from the car. Angushed I took my kid all alone for the hair-cut
and was free by 4:50 PM. I came back to the car with the kid with the cut, and started for home. My wife kept
abusing me for all the wrongs supposedly in the cut. I ignored and drove as fast as I could for home. We were back
home by 5:15 PM.
