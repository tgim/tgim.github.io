default: Curious case of missing passport photo
---

One fine morning, I reach my office at around 10 AM. At around 10:30 AM, my wife call me and asks me as to
why I picked up her passport size photograph from the drawer and took with me to the office. I explained, that
we bought a leather sheath to keep two pics together, one for her and one for me. Thus, I took her pic so that
I can put it in my sheath and keep it with me always. It was our locket that had our pics together.

She didn't agree to it. By 11 AM she was at my office security gate shouting at me. She called me and asked
me to come downstairs and handover the pic immediately. I told her that I was in a meeting and that she might
need to wait for 10 minutes before I can come downstairs. She created such a hue-and-cry with the security that
I received mutiple calls from them.

As I was in a crucial meeting, I had to ask one of my collegaues to take the pic to her. He went downstairs and
handed over to her the paper envelope I had given him - containing her pic. She took it and bid him bye. But, this
is not the end of the story.

She kept shouting at security of my office, and asked me to come downstairs. Such was the number of incoming calls
and text messages, that finally I had to ask my manager to allow me to leave the meeting in between. Once down
stairs, she asked me:

> To come with her immediately to home. And explain why I had taken the pic with me.

I kept explaining her the same. I also reasoned that if I had intended some harm to her, then I had her
thousands of pics with me, from honeymoon to eating out, to travelling to posing and what not. Thus she should
think what difference a single pic would mean to me in such a case.

> She did not listen and kept creating a scene at my office. I asked her to leave. She threw the house keys
> on the main road in front of my office.

At this point, I called her up father to pacify her up. He as usual asked me:

> To leave for home immediately with her. That if she leaves for home all alone, that will count towards
> domestic violence and her torture.

I had lost my mind at this point. I then took her home, dropped her home and went out.

For the next many hours, almost 6 hours, I was standing at a railway station near my place. Looking at every
train that was incoming. The only thing running in my head was:

> How much would it pain if I jumped in front of it? Will I die instantly. What if I don't die? Will I be 
> behind bars for domestic violence as her father had threatened? Was there another sure-shot way to commit suicide.

**Yes, this was the first time in my life when I had actually gone out of home for suicide.**

There was something that kept me away from taking my life. Fear for my parents, Fear that once I will be gone
my wife will ruin their lives, and make sure that they were behind bars for being thrown out of their own home.
I till date, almost 3 years to the incident, regret for **NOT JUMPING**.
