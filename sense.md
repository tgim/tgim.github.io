### How to sense a troublesome wife - a dominant or gold-digger

Some of the actions done by wives who will try to rule your life - either be excessively dominany or a gold-digger are:

1. She will slowly delete all her family, relatives, and friends contact details from your phone books - she doesn't want
that her support people know the real story

1. Before she begins assault on you, she would spread word in her family, relatives and friends that you are not too good
- either are too voilent or aggressive

1. She will first skip a few events/functions/social gatherings indicating that she is not well - on her side she would
say that you did not want to come and also refused her to go

1. She will try and delete all previous chats/emails (mostly the ones before marriage) from your account

1. She will initially sound too loving and accepting - will ask you to tell about each friend in your facebook account

1. If she maintains a separate email account just to converse with you - and a different one for everyone else

1. She will not accept your family status request on Facebook for years so that you can't get to know her friends

1. Even if she does, you will be blocked to see her timeline and her friend list

1. She will keep asking you for money - small amounts - for every small task - 100 bucks for threading, 500 for facial, 100
bucks for auto/cab, and so on. Basically, notice if she ever spends anything from her own salary - if she does not, then
it might be a problem

1. She will keep forcing you to buy jewellery now and then - ear rings, finger rings and more. But, she will not wear them.
She will also at times talk of selling old jewellery and picking up new

1. She will talk that you do not share your financial details with her - like salary earned, where did you spend and all

1. She will try and make you avoid any party/function that will be for your enjoyment - even fuel saved is money saved

1. She is very bossy/rash with house-hold workers - also - she will blame you for her miseries in front of them - she is
making alibi to prove you are ruthless

1. She will not do any house hold chore - will ask yuo for water - almost always - this indicates she is damn lazy
and is not willing to spend enery for this relationship

1. Ask her for a medicine like Disprin that involves searching in the medical kit when she is talking reading the
newspaper or watching TV - if she doesn't get you the medicine in next one hour, even after reminders - she doesn't care
for you
