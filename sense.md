### How to sense a troublesome wife - a dominant or gold-digger

Some of the actions done by wives who will try to rule your life - either be excessively dominany or a gold-digger are:

1. She will slowly delete all her family, relatives, and friends contact details from your phone books - she doesn't want
that her support people know the real story

1. Before she begins assault on you, she would spread word in her family, relatives and friends that you are not too good
- either are too voilent or aggressive

1. She will first skip a few events/functions/social gatherings indicating that she is not well - on her side she would
say that you did not want to come and also refused her to go

1. She will try and delete all previous chats/emails (mostly the ones before marriage) from your account

1. She will initially sound too loving and accepting - will ask you to tell about each friend in your facebook account

1. If she maintains a separate email account just to converse with you - and a different one for everyone else

1. She will not accept your family status request on Facebook for years so that you can't get to know her friends

1. Even if she does, you will be blocked to see her timeline and her friend list
