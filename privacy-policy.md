### Privacy Policy

The site does not collect any personal information whatsoever. 

The site might use third-party website traffic monitoring scripts like Google Analytics 
or StatCounter.com to see how much traffic are we generating and from where in the world 
are people coming in from. For now I am happy with Github provided traffic graphs.

I will update this very page if there are changes to the policy.
