### Privacy Policy

The site does not collect any personal information whatsoever. The site however uses `disqus.com`
based commenting system - to let users voice their opinion.  To filter out spam and abuse, all
comments are moderated.

The site uses third-party website traffic monitoring script: `Google Analytics`
to see how much traffic are we generating and from where in the world 
are people coming in from. I am also happy with Github provided traffic graphs, but the more
the merrier.

I will update this very page if there are changes to the policy.
