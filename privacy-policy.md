The site does not collect any personal information whatsoever. The site however uses `disqus.com`
based commenting system - to let users voice their opinion.  To filter out spam and abuse, all
comments are moderated.

The site uses third-party website traffic monitoring script: `Google Analytics`
to see how much traffic are we generating and from where in the world 
are people coming in from. This helps me visualize how much effort do I need to put in to this 
project - for it takes a lot of effort to write what you face everyday.

I will update this very page if there are changes to the policy.
