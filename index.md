### The Great Indian Marriage

This is a personal account of what I have experienced in the so-called `The Great Indian Marriage` - which we as Indian are very proud
of - like we are of culture and history and our past. However, the reality I have lived in the past many years makes me differ on the
subject. I am no longer proud of the belief that we Indians have a cultural legacy, a traditional supremacy over any other and that
our beliefs and traditions are better than others.

### Who Am I

I am just another husband in just another Indian arranged-marriage.
