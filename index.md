### The Great Indian Marriage

This is a personal account of what I have experienced in the so-called `The Great Indian Marriage` - which we as Indian are very proud
of - like we are of culture and history and our past. However, the reality I have lived in the past many years makes me differ on the
subject. I am no longer proud of the belief that we Indians have a cultural legacy, a traditional supremacy over any other and that
our beliefs and traditions are better than others.

Today, many women in India marry with the only intention of digging gold - and their number is increasing day-by-day. You know why?
Because the laws in India are so much titled in favor of women that even the courts have termed it as **legal terrorism**. Look up
Google to know more on this.

### Who Am I?

I am just another husband in just another Indian arranged-marriage, who suffers abuse every day-and-night - one who can't work
properly, can't devote time for office, can't meet his family and friends, nurturing my child like a single-working-father, yet
called married and need to pay for all luxuries of someone who doesn't even care for me.

I write my personal story here for it relieves me of all the stress, thinking that I have someone to listen to me. May be someday
someone will say - hey, you know, your life-story helped me out in dealing with mine better. That will be the day when I would
not be alone here.

Also, I know that sooner or later I will be hit **legally** and I won't be able to remember what all happened. May be things will
be so worse that I would be gone too far to immediately relieve me of my pain. At that time, may be people who will still live
will need pointers to survive - they will need to know the real truth.
