Following are the perfect safe ways to kill your husband, tried and tested that take effect slowly and steadily. They are meant to 
be used in an Indian marriage, but may work for others as well. Rest assured no law will consider you a suspect.

### Cut him off from family and friends

* If you are cooking for his parents - make sure the food is either **under-cooked** or **over-cooked**. The breads/chapatis must be
burnt. Depending on the families taste, put a lot of extra chilli or no-spice at all

* If he is also at the table, make sure that his food is palatable and only the stuff for his parents is non-eatable.

* If he is not home at night (an office-trip may be) call him up at night at 12 AM and tell him that you are feeling a lot scared. The 
next night if he asks his mother to sleep with you, make sure you make the night a hell for her (see tips below), else repeat the call

* Once its been a few months to marriage, make sure you take an off some day. During one of his meetings, call him up and tell that
you are feeling scared that his parents would kill you. If he asks for a reason, say its just a hunch.

* If there is a family function, make sure you make everyone late by a couple of hours. Either go and sit in the washroom to pretend
that your stomach is upset. Or you have a severe headache. Or your dress is not ironed. Or try searching for matching bangles or any
damn thing, that can cause unjustified delay

* If you are with his friends, be blunt to jokes. Make sure that his friends feel bad that evening - and the next time refrain from
being together with you

* If its his mother who has cooked food, make sure you cry hell for it being either too spicy, or too warm. If nothing works, pick up
a spice/condiment and proclaim that you are allergic to it - now feel free to make a mountain out of the molehill - that his mom is
trying to make you fall ill

### Suspicion

This is another easy thing to try. Just be suspicious of what ever he does, say:

* If you call him up and his phone is busy, abuse that he is speaking to his parents planning to get rid of you

* Make sure you call the house-maid early in the morning. Keep sleeping and force him to be awake - he would for he needs to reach
office on time. Then once a month get up at the time when he and the maid are in vicinity - and then accuse him of having an affair
with her.

* If he has a day off, make sure that you call the maid when he is alone at home. If he gets the cleaning done, you are free to
abuse/curse - if he does not then he increased work for you - he is making you a slave

* Accuse/abuse/curse him of having an affair with any of his female team-mates - just pick any young lady in his team - and then
you are all set. Make sure that you bring this thing every now and then on chat conversations that he is having an affair

### Drain him financially

* Make sure that you never pay up - not even for going to office, or buying yourself a burger. If need be, steal money from his
wallet - but don't ever use your own salary for any expense that is for him, for your home, or for your children

* Buy up vegetables and fruits and make sure that they are left unsued, they rot and lastly need to be thrown in the dust bin.
You may employ this technique almost everyday and the effect is quite high

* Buy exotic chocolates, pastries, fruits etc. Make sure he cannot consume them saying that they are just for you. Take them to
office and bring them back - state that you had a hell lot of work load. Ensure them to rot and finally land up in the garbage
bin

* Make sure you discard some old items of the house which are dear to him, just for no reason

* Whenever you have a fight, throw the various remote-controls (like TV, cable-tv, internet etc) on the wall in a fit-of-rage.
A couple of attempts and then you need to buy them again.

* Don't cook - or sound too over-jealous to eat out. Make sure that you eat atleast 5 dinners in a week outside - ask him to pay
- the food bill itself will make sure that it pinches him at the right place

* If you have children, specially infants/toddlers/kids - buy a lot of clothes for them - new designs - new colors from the most
expensive brands

* Without asking him, just order stuff online with `Cash-on-delivery` option - make sure the delivery address is his office address.
If he doesn't pay - you have a reason to fight. If he does pay - you are spot on.

* Force him to buy you a car - tell him that this will make sure that he can devote more time for his work at office. Once 
he finalizes the car and makes all the payments - and cancelling the car is sure to cost him a few ten-thousands - back off.
Tell him that you don't need the car anymore - that you changed your mind - as there is a lot of traffic and too many accidents
happen.

### Spoil all his favorite items

There would definitely be things that he would love. Its your job to spoil them up so that they cannot be used again. Following
are some of the examples that serve handy:

* Put his favorite clothes in the washing machine - put wet-detergent over his clothes and make sure the washing machine does not
run for a day or two - the stains of the detergent will render them useless in 2-3 such washes

* Try and break his favorite coffee mugs/glasses pretending that you slipped

* Make sure that some of his cherished pics - like his college pics are gone and cannot be found. May be burn them.

### Wake him at night say around 3 AM

Wake him up often at say, 3 AM or 4 AM. This is the peak time one needs to catch sleep and is very difficult to be awake. You
may need to sleep in early for the same. The following excuses  can be used to wake him up:

* You are feeling a lot uneasy and immediately need water - make sure the water is not in room, or that you needed it a little
warm. Once he fetches it, just drink a sip and sleep again. Wake up 30 minutes later and repeat. The water/milk by this time is
cold again

* You had a real bad-dream and you would want to talk to him - tell him that you saw his parents killing her, or that he was
getting married a second time, or that his second wife was torturing you. Just choose a reason that will provoke him to fight

* You need to talk to him about something very unimportant - like should you change your job, or should you take a couple of
days of holiday and go home

* If you are awake since the evening, haven't slept, show him 10 different selfies of yours and ask him which one is the best
to be put up as the display pic in various social profiles - **bonus points** for this as this will really frustrate him out

### Morning-delay to office

* He has an important meeting/work in the office at 10 AM. Make sure that he is delayed - do this repeatedly without fail. The 
excuses you may use may range from
  
  * you have a severe headache, or stomach ache and need to go to the doctor
  
  * you will be ready in 5 minutes, every time he asks in that 1-hour window
  
  * go to the temple to offer prayers saying you would be back in 5 minutes - make sure you do not take the house keys with
  you - thus assured he needs to wait
  
  * leave with him for office, mid-way ask him to turn back - as you forgot your purse and office access-card and you would
  be denied entry - thus making sure he needs to return back

* Just in case he decides to leave for office, call him 5 minutes after he has left, and tell him that he doesn't care for you.
Emotionally wrench him, hit him. Tell him that you can't even go to the office, and he left you to die.

  * If he returns back mid-way then make sure you delay again by 10-15 minutes and leave with him. 

  * If he does not come, reach your own office immediately. Call him from your office number, and ask him the time when doctor 
  would be available. Tell him that you left 5 minutes after he left, and he is such an a**hole that he did not wait. Tell him 
  that you are so unwell, that you are asking a friend in office to take you to doctor.
  
* As life moves ahead, he will start keeping buffer - make sure you adjust for that buffer. The buffer
may range anywhere between 30 minutes to 60 minutes - you have to be vigilant to know the exact buffer and account for it.

* In case you have a kid, its very easy to delay him - make sure the kid get cranky in the morning - keep the kiddo awake for a
long time the previous night. The kid will not wake him up next morning on time. You can delay getting the kid ready, preparing
the school bag, the kids tiffin and all.

* If its winters, you can always add extra time by making sure there is no warm-water to take the bath. 

* You may also employ tricks like making sure there is no milk/breads/eggs or something necessary in the morning. Ask him to fetch
it in the morning itself, adding further to the delay for the meeting

* If you have pretty advance notice, make sure you ask the house-maid to be late in the morning - everything gets offset due
to this

### Office trouble

* Always call him for something very important during his office meetings - track his meetings, the daily ones and weekly meetings.
Switch to a prepaid number, and ask him to recharge as you need to speak very urgently with someone. 

* Call him up and provoke him to get aggressive - as soon as his voice/tone gets a little louder - start crying that he is shouting
in front of his colleagues

* Ask him to come early every evening, as you would like to go for snacks

* If there is something very urgent in office which needs him to stay late at night, start feeling ill - call him every 10 minutes
and say that you are feeling `vommittish` - if he comes home, pretend that you are not well. If he doesn't pick up a cab/auto and
go to a doctor. Inform him on SMS that are you at doctor's place and too ill. Don't pick any of his calls or respond to his SMS
for the next 30 minutes.

* Dictate that he will not interview any lady at his office, and that he will not work with any lady - if his team has one, ask him
to change his team

### Social Media Hell

* Unleash hell on social media - fight with him if he likes/comments on any news topic that is posted by a female - even if that is
of a celebrity

* If he likes the display pic of a female friend, fight during the office time - make sure he cannot keep the phone for 30 minutes

* Try and chat with him for hours during office time - this will ensure that he cannot complete his work on time. Make sure to throw
in phrases like he is harrassing you for money, or beating you up.

* If you ever find his social account online:

  * unfriend some of his female friends
  
  * impersonate him, and scold a female friend with whom he had a recent chat to mind her own business
  
  * Or just impersonate to say, that his wife is troubling him - when the lady responds - you can abuse/curse him again

* Spend all day on `Facebook` or `WhatsApp` - delaying every house hold chore - breakfast, lunch, dinner. If the child needs
attention - ask the kid to go to dad.

### Weekend Hell

* Make sure that you don't get ready before 6 PM - then abuse him that he wasted the whole day and weekend of yours. Curse him as much
as you can

* If you have a plan to go out-of-town, and you decide to leave say at 11 AM. Make sure that you have some urgent office work that finishes
up at 6 PM - now you have two reasons to abuse/curse him

* Take a lazy Saturday - wake up too late. If he eats something himself for breakfast, abuse/curse him - if he waits it ensures that he
will be in a bad mood to experiment another trick

### Child care

If there are kids in the marriage, make sure that he tends to everything with them.

* If the kid is sick, you have a very important task at office - and thus, he needs to take a leave. If he doesn't agrees to, drop the sick
kid to school or day-care. Fathers are soft-hearted to children, he would take a leave. If he doesn't - you have the lifetime license to 
abuse/curse him

* If its your kids birthday, plan a day out with the kids. At the last moment, cancel the trip and spend the day in office. 

* At home make the spend most of the time with dad. This will ensure that the father has less time for work, and is more emotionally attached.
Thus when child is sick, or if the child needs attention, the child will need the father. 

* If the child is cranky, or inconsolable - shout on him that he cant take care of the child - and what a irresponsible father he is. Shout that
his parents didn't teach him any stuff, and that he is treating you like a full time baby-sitter

If your children are old enough to understand, you can always make them understand that your mother works hard whereas your father has nothing
to do in office. A simple win-win situation.

### Miscelleaneous

* Starve him for sex - don't have sex for not just weeks, but for months

* If you catch him watching porn, accuse him of being characterless

* Abuse him as much as you can. Phrases like `son of a bitch`, `scoundrel`, `dog's pup`, and more can be used in every other conversation.
Start using these phrases first calling him lovingly. Then make sure that you do that every 20th statement of yours. If he objects, say
that you have learnt them from him

* While driving, point out to all his non-mistakes. 

  * If someone overtakes first, abuse him. 
  
  * If he doesn't jump the red-light abuse him of making you late. If he jumps the red-light, abuse him for trying to kill you in an
  accident

* During a fight, try and slap him. If he holds your hands to prevent, abuse him that you got blues and pain because he beat you up. Repeat
the statements in loud voice at home, and on chat conversations

* Throw a slipper at him, if he throws it back - throw one of his slipper out of the house in the garbage bin. Abuse him in chat that he 
beat you up

* Delete some of his contacts from his cell phone, specially female friends. Delete some of his old pics from college, and say it happened
by mistake

* Last but not the least, delete the numbers of all your own relatives and friends. Make sure that he cannot contact any of your parents,
family, cousins or friends.

In the end, I can just say that these worked in my case, and I feel like a dead-man walking this planet. Your mileage may vary.
