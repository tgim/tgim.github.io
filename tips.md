### Tips to handle dominant/gold-digger wives

If you think or-are sure that your wife is trying to be overtly-dominating or is just digging gold, following
tips might help you from the deadly 498a threat.

1. First and foremost, be true and genuine. DO NOT cook-up facts and stories.

1. Make sure that you keep a record of all chat conversations - take a regular backup. Let someone trust-worthy
know of where they are and how to access them.

1. Keep an online log of the important fights - who said what - and what happened.

1. Come what may, never physically assault the lady - I know it can be very tough specially if she starts throwing
slippers, or slaps you out - but duck as much as you can - or leave the place.

1. Keep all bills (phone bills, restaurant, shopping) - just click a photo, or scan them. Store online

1. Save all emails - take a dump and store online. Your wife will try to delete them as soon as she gets access
to your accounts

1. Change your passwords of phone, all social accounts, emails etc frequently. Use a password generator like
<a href="https://github.com/jcoglan/vault">Vault</a> for all sites - you remember one single password, and it
generates different for all sites

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on all your sites - GMail, Facebook and most major sites do support them. This
will mean that no one can login to your account even if they get hold of master password.

1. Do not trust any computer - and never be signed-in eternally

1. Logout of all online sessions (like in GMail and Facebook) once every week - this means that only the current
session is live, and all other devices sign out. You might need to login - but trust me - I didn't do this once
and lost a lot of logs

1. If she abuses you on phone, record all your conversations. There are plenty of open-source free-call recording
applications available for `Android/iOS/Windows/other` platforms - use them. If the sound of the second party is
faint, use a software like <a href="http://audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> to enhance the voices. Store all the
original as well as enhanced clips online. The filename should indicate the date of call and hint as to what are
the contents

1. Be courageous, and be happy. It will end too - just takes a long time - a few years might be.
